You are holding your monthly review fair.

All teams present four to five innovations and are clearly proud of what they have achieved and are looking to talk to trade fair visitors. Overall, the review fair makes a good impression.

But one exhibition stand looks unmaintained. Only half of the team seems to be present. The team's results are not visible.
