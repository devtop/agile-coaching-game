Draw another roll (roll X) from the face-down pile. The following event refers to this role X.

Role X is coming your way. Role X is very frustrated with your organizational development. Product development would stall, nothing would move forward.

Role X tells you that Role X is thinking about quitting: &quot;I don't have anything new yet. Also not looking for anything. But I don't feel like it anymore!&quot;
