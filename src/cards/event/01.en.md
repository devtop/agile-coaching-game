During the dailies, the team identified two tasks that still need to be completed. One of the tasks is to be solved with the new framework, the other task is a story that will replace a bug in the old system with a new feature. In the Daily, Andrea and Lukas could not agree on who would do which task.

Right after the Daily, Andrea and Lukas are talking. Suddenly, Lukas gets up and shouts: &quot;It is always me, being the idiot!&quot; and runs out of the team room.
