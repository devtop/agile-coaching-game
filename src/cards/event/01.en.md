During the dailies, the team identified two tasks that still need to be completed. One of the tasks is to be solved with the new framework, the other task is a story that will replace a bug in the old system with a new feature. In the Daily, Andrea and Lukas couldn't agree on who would take on which task.

Andrea and Lukas have a chat straight after the Daily. All of a sudden, Lukas stands up and shouts: &quot;I'm always the fool!&quot; and runs out of the team room.
