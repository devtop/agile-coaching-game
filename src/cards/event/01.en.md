During the dailies, the team identified two tasks that still need to be completed. One of the tasks is to be solved with the new framework, the other task is a story that will replace a bug in the old system with a new feature. In the Daily, Andrea and Lukas couldn't agree on who would take on which task.

Right after the Daily, Andrea and Lukas start discussing. Suddenly, Lukas gets up and shouts: &quot;It is always me, being the fool!&quot; and runs out of the team room.
