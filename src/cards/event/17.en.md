The company's management meets with selected senior executives to discuss the company's growth strategy.
Last year you achieved growth of 17%. The management suggests that the same figure should be targeted for the coming year.
A senior colleague rebels: &quot;That was really at the expense of all the teams with a lot of overtime. I don't agree with that. We need more people.&quot; The management replies that hiring significantly more staff is financially not viable in times of growth.
This retort ends the discussion.
