The managers meet once a week for a JourFixe. This group holds retrospectives at irregular intervals.

All product teams work entirely according to agile methods. The rest of the company is classically oriented. Jour fixes, project status and project management meetings are common.

Most of the communication takes place via e-mail. Meetings are usually without an agenda. The results are often not binding.
