The managers meet once a week for a JourFixe. This group holds retrospectives on an irregular basis.

All product teams work entirely according to agile methods. The rest of the company is classically oriented. Jour fixes, project status and project management meetings are common.

Communication mainly takes place by e-mail. Meetings are generally without an agenda -- the results are often not binding.
