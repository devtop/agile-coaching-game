Production works in scrum teams. The retrospectives take place regularly every three weeks. The teams organize themselves with daily stand-ups and wall newspapers. The reviews do not take place regularly. The dates are heavily dependent on the schedules of the management and the customers.

The non-project team members report directly to the management. The management and the product owners meet in a weekly jour fixe.
