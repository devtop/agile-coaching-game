Production is done in Scrum teams. Retrospectives are held regularly every three weeks. The teams organize themselves with Daily Stand-Ups and wall-boards. The Reviews do not take place on a regular basis. Schedules are highly dependent on management and customer schedules.

Non-project team members report directly to the management. The management and the product owners meet in a weekly Jour Fixe.
