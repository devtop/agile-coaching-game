Your scrum masters are responsible for the process and take great care of the teams. The product owners drive the teams to peak performance in terms of content. Reviews take place frequently - where the focus is on the production teams' demos. What has been achieved is rarely integrated into the product vision - the requirements change too quickly. The retrospectives are carried out in the production teams.

The product owners negotiate the numerical and product targets with the management.
