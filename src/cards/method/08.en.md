Your Scrum Masters are responsible for the processes and take great care of the teams. The product owners drive the teams to achieve excellence in terms of content. Reviews are frequent - with a focus on the production teams' demos. What has been achieved is rarely integrated into the product vision - the requirements change too quickly. Retrospectives are held in the production teams.

The product owners negotiate the figures and product targets with the management.
