The company has the ethos of a project company. Depending on the task at hand, traditional or agile project teams are set up by the division managers. If necessary, personnel changes are made in these teams. Lessons learned after projects and retrospectives during projects are common. The results are implemented well by the teams.

The management of the company is organized in a classic hierarchical structure. Project reporting takes place within these structures. Customers are approached directly from the teams.
