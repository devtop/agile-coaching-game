The company has the ethos of a project company. Depending on the task, traditional or agile project teams are set up by the business unit managers. If necessary, personnel changes are made in these teams. Lessons learned after projects and retrospectives during projects are a common practice. The results are well implemented by the teams.

The management of the company is organized in a classical hierarchical structure. Project reporting is done within these structures. Customers are addressed directly by the teams.
