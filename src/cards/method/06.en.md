Since the start of the business, you have had a basic idea of how you handle the product and the parallel day-to-day business. In principle, you work &quot;in the same way as last time&quot;. The project management specifies the next activities.
If a project goes wrong, you do a half-day, moderated &quot;Lessons learned&quot;session.

The managers know the annual targets (in figures, for example the expected margin) for all projects and areas.
You set annual numerical targets with all employees.
