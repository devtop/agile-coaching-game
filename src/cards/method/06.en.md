Since the beginning of the business, you have had a basic idea of how you handle the product and the parallel day-to-day business. In principle, you work &quot;in the same way as last time&quot;. The project management specifies the next activities.
If a project goes wrong, you have a half-day facilitated &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; session.

The managers know for all projects and areas the annual targets (in figures, e.g. the expected margin).
You set annual targets with all employees.
