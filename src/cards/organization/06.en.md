Your company is heavily driven by Procurement. That's where the margin is. Procurement is divided into ten categories. The category is fully responsible for its own area. Innovations in sales are motivated by the specific interests of each category.

In addition to Procurement, there is Sales (50 stores in Germany, 1 online store), Marketing (you believe in TV advertising), Finance + Controlling, Legal, and Human Resources.
