Your company is strongly driven by purchasing. That's where the margin is. Purchasing is divided into ten categories. The sections are each fully responsible for their own area. Innovations in sales are motivated by the interests of the categories.

In addition to purchasing, there is sales (50 stores in Germany, 1 online store), marketing (you rely on TV advertising), finance + controlling, legal and human resources.
