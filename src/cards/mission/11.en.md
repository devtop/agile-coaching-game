You are a print shop. 2/3 of your staff work directly in printing and logistics.

Orders are accepted online. You try to automate as many processes as possible. In addition to IT, you have departments such as Product Management, Finance + Controlling, Complaints Management and Key Account Management.

Your goal is to seamlessly integrate external print jobs into your customers' operations.
