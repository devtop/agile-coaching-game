You are a print shop. 2/3 of your staff are employed directly in the print shop and in logistics.

Orders are accepted online. You try to automate as many processes as possible. In addition to IT, you will have areas such as product management, finance + controlling, complaint management and key account management.

Your aim is to integrate external print jobs seamlessly into the customers' work.
