You are a print shop. 2/3 of your staff work directly in printing and logistics.

Orders are accepted online. You try to automate as many processes as possible. In addition to IT, you will be responsible for areas such as product management, finance + controlling, complaints management and key account management.

Your aim is to integrate external print jobs seamlessly into the customers' work.
