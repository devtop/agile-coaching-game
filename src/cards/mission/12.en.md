You are an organic bakery. You were founded by a male rural baker and a female business economist.

In addition to production in the bakery, you also employ developers, as you use a subscription system to send bread and specially made baked goods to your customers. Orders are placed online.

You want to bring the charm of the country bakery into every household.
