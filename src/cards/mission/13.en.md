You are developing an entirely new software for text capture. You bring it all together: Desktop, mobile, voice recording.

You want to take text capture to a new dimension. You want a world where text is created without the effort of speaking. &quot;Just say it&quot; is your motto.

You are living off the first round of funding. You are spending 10% more money per month than you planned.
