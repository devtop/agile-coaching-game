**Our Success Proves us Right!**

You constantly assess the market. To achieve success and maximize profits, you adapt your actions and strategic decisions in the short term. This adaptability extends to restructuring your teams fast. You celebrate every good idea and willingly follow those with a keen instinct. This is reflected in unconventional role titles— your CEO is the “Chief Revolution Officer,”  and your technology leader holds the title of “Chief Trolling Officer”. Some say you celebrate yourselves too much - while overlooking essential aspects.
