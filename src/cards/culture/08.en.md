**Our Success Proves us Right!**

You constantly assess the market. For success and profit maximization, your actions and strategic decisions are subject to rapid change. For that, you also restructure your teams quickly. You celebrate every good idea and willingly follow those with a keen instinct. This is reflected in unconventional role titles: your CEO is the “Chief Revolution Officer", and your head of technology holds the title “Chief Trolling Officer”. Some say you celebrate yourselves too much - while overlooking essential aspects.
