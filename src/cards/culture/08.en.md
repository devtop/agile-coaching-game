**Our Success Proves us Right!**

You constantly monitor the market. For success and profit maximization, your actions and strategic decisions are changed in the short term. For this, you also rebuild your teams quickly. You celebrate every good idea and like to follow those who have a good nose. You manifest this with extraordinary role titles. Your Managing Director is &quot;Chief Revolution Officer&quot;. Your technology is managed by the &quot;Chief Trolling Officer&quot; . Some say you celebrate yourselves too much - and don't pay sufficient attention to the essentials.
