**Spezialist\*innen, bitte!**

There are special forces for every topic. The decision is reserved for these specialists. If you come across a problem, look for the corresponding special forces.

You expect your managers to know all the specialists. Decisions are made by them. You wait until the best person for the job has time to complete the task at hand.
