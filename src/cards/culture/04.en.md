**Specialists, please!**

There are special forces for each topic. And decisions are reserved for these specialists. If you come across a problem, you are looking for the corresponding special forces.

You expect your managers to know all the specialists. Decisions are made by them. You wait until the best person for the job has time to complete the task at hand.
