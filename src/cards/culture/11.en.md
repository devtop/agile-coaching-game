**Our founders are incredibly good!**

Your founders are charismatic people. When it comes down to it, they roll up their sleeves and get deeply involved in the operational business. Strategic decisions are made by your founders - they know the business best. In your daily life, you try to decide in their favor. As the founder is often elusive, discuss with your colleagues how you should act in such cases.
Some say that the empowerment of employees is not high.
