**Our founders are incredibly good!**

Your founders are charismatic people. When it comes down to it, they roll up their sleeves and get deeply involved in the operational business. Strategic decisions are made by your founders - they know the business best. In your daily life, you try to decide in their favor. Since the founders are often not to be grasped, you discuss with your colleagues how to act in the respective case.
Some say that the empowerment of employees is not high.
