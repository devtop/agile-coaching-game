**Our Founders are Incredibly Skilled!**

Your founders are charismatic individuals  who roll up their sleeves and immerse themselves in the day-to-day operations when necessary. Strategic decisions are made by your founders - because they understand the business best. In your daily work, you strive to make decisions aligned with their vision. Since the founders are often unavailable, you discuss with your colleagues how to handle the relevant situation.
Some say that the empowerment of employees is not high.
