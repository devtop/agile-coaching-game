**We talk about everything!**

Where you work in an agile way, you are adept and experienced in the methods. Your team leads take good care of the teams and try to protect them from any disruptions.
If things get stuck, you are sure that it is because the managers &quot;agile&quot; have not yet understood it properly. In the event of a conflict, you point out that they still have a lot of catching up to do. This accusation is incomprehensible to the managers. They receive regular coaching. The mistakes are clearly on the team side.
