**We talk about everything!**

Where you work agilely, you are savvy and experienced in the methods. Your team leaders take good care of the teams and try to shield them from any disruptions.
When things go wrong, you are convinced that it is because the leaders have not yet fully understood 'agile'. In the event of conflict, you point out that they still have a lot of catching up to do. For the leaders this accusation is not understandable. They regularly seek coaching. The mistakes clearly lie on the team's side.
