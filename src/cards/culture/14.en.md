**We Talk About Everything!**

Where you work agile, you are savvy and experienced in the methods. Your team leads take good care of the teams and try to shield them from any disruptions.
When things go wrong, you are convinced that it is because the leads have not yet fully understood 'agile'. In case of conflict, you point out that they still have a lot to catch up on. The leads don't understand this accusation. They regularly seek coaching. The mistakes clearly lie on the team's side.
