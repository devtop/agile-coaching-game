**We talk about everything!**

Where you work in an agile way, you are adept and experienced in the methods. Your team leads take good care of the teams and try to protect them from any disruptions.
When it hooks, you are sure that this is because the managers have not yet understood &quot;agile&quot; properly. In the event of conflict, you point out that they still have a lot of catching up to do. For the managers this accusation is incomprehensible. They receive regular coaching. The mistakes are clearly on the team side.
