**Defense is Paramount!**

You always strive to achieve the best possible outcomes. Therefore you defend every decision and every project status. You demonstrate that you have always acted to the best of your knowledge, conscience, and understanding. For error analyses, it is important to know who made a wrong decision. Because mistakes are a sign of incompetence.

You often interpret factual and status questions as negative criticism.
