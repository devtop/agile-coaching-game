**Defense comes first!**

You always try to achieve the best. That's why you defend every decision and every project status. You prove that you have always acted to the best of your knowledge, conscience and expertise. For error analyses, it is important to know who made a wrong decision. Because mistakes are a sign of incompetence.

You often interpret factual and status issues as negative criticism.
