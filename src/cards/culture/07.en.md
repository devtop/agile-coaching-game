**Security! We want Security!**

You demand clear processes and responsibilities. You feel secure when everything is tightly regulated.

The actual decision always rests with the superiors, who ensure fair and transparent solutions.
You often think that too much time is spent discussing the “what” and not enough courage is shown in addressing the “how”.
