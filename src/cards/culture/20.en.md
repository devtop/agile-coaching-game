**The customer is king!**

You are a true customer advocate! When the customer calls, you respond to their request without delay. You pride yourselves on responding quickly and comprehensively to customer requests.

Some say you are too submissive towards customers. They also say that you would subordinate your own vision to this submissive attitude.
