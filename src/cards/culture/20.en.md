**The customer is king!**

You are a true customer advocate! When the customer calls, you respond to their request without delay. You pride yourselves on addressing customer requests quickly and comprehensively.

Some say you are too submissive to the customers. They also say you would subordinate your own vision to this submissive attitude.
