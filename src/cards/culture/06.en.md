**Processes? We are Professionals!**

You value clear processes and responsibilities. When you define a process, you formulate it in detail and cover all exceptions. Whenever possible, you promptly transfer this process into a digital workflow. For every business incident you have the appropriate form available on the intranet.

This approach provides you with a sense of security. Sometimes you feel that you have lost speed.
