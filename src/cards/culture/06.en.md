**Processes? We are Professionals!**

You value clear processes and responsibilities. When defining a process, you articulate it in detail, including all exceptions. Whenever possible, you promptly transfer this process into a digital workflow. For every business incident you have the appropriate form available on the intranet.

This approach provides you with a sense of security. Occasionally, you feel that some speed has been lost.
