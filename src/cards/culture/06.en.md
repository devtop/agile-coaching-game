**Processes? We are Professionals!**

You value clear processes and responsibilities. When you define a process, you formulate it in detail and with all exceptions. If possible, you transfer this process immediately to a digital workflow. For every business transaction you have the right form on the intranet.

You like this approach because it gives you security. Sometimes you feel that you have lost speed.
