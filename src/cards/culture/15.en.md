**The Need to Learn!**

Learning is your top priority. If something goes wrong, you immediately call for a postmortem.  It is important to you that every failure is recognized as an opportunity to learn. You look for opportunities for improvement in informal meetings - as well as in retrospectives within the team and the company. Your biggest learnings are always on display in the kitchen. This provides an opportunity for further discussions.

Some say you talk too much -- and act too little.
