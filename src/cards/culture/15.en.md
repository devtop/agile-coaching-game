**Learning, learning, and learning again!**

Learning is everything to you. When something goes wrong, you immediately call for a postmortem analysis.  It is important to you that every failure is recognized as an opportunity for learning. In informal settings, you look for ways to improveâ€”just as you do in team retrospectives and in the company. Your biggest learnings are constantly displayed in the kitchen. This sparks further discussions.

Some say you talk too much -- and act too little.
