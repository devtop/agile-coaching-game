**Learning, Learning, and Learning again!**

Learning is everything to you. When something goes wrong, you immediately call for a postmortem analysis.  It is important to you that every failure is recognized as an opportunity for learning. You look for ways to improve in informal settings - just as you do in team and company retrospectives. Your biggest learnings are constantly displayed in the kitchen. This provides opportunity for further discussions.

Some say you talk too much -- and act too little.
