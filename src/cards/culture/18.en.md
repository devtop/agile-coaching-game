**We never argue.**

You are proud of your good working atmosphere. You have a great supply of fruit, cold drinks, barista coffee and a good table football. You always find good solutions quickly. You don't have controversies. If you ever disagree, you'll quickly find your way back to everyday life.

Some say that nobody dares to speak out and resolve conflicts. They also say that there are many unresolved, cold conflicts in the house.
