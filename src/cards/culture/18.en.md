**We never argue.**

You take pride in your good working atmosphere. You have great amenities with a good foosball table, fruit, cold drinks and barista coffee. You always find good solutions quickly. You don't engage in controversies. If you don't agree on something, you quickly return to everyday life.

Some say that nobody dares to address and resolve conflicts. They also say that there are many unresolved, simmering conflicts in the house.
