**Safety First!**

In your company you are as inclusive as possible. Before making a group decision, it is checked carefully, that all possible stakeholders have been consulted. You are proud of the fact, that all important decisions are made by consensus and with consideration.

There are voices which say, no one is taking responsibility.
