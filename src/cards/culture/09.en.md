Only Management Really Counts!

Your business is complex, requiring careful consideration. Your management team has deep knowledge of the business.
They delegate many tasks to the team. You are enthusiastic about the level of responsibility, youâ€™re entrusted with. Upon completion of a task, you present the result. And often this routine seems to be right: the management finds something that needs to be changed, which you then implement.

Some say the management pseudo-involves the team.
