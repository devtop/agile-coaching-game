\*\*Management is what truly counts! \*\*

Your business is complex, requiring careful consideration. Your management team has deep knowledge of the business.
They delegate many tasks to the team. You are enthusiastic about the level of responsibility, youâ€™re entrusted with. Upon completion of a task, you present the result. And oftentimes, this seems to be right: the management identifies areas for improvement that you then implement.

Some say the GF would pseudo-involve the team.
