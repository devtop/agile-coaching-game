**Only Management Really Counts!**

Your business is complex, requiring careful consideration. Your management team has deep knowledge of the business.
They delegate many tasks to the team. You are enthusiastic about the level of responsibility, youâ€™re entrusted with. Upon completion of a task, you present the result. And often this happens rightfully: the management still sees a need for change that you then implement.

Some say the management pseudo-involves the team.
