**Only the management really counts!**

Your business is complex. There is a lot to think about. Your management knows the business well.
The management delegates many tasks to the team. You are amazed at how much you can do yourselves. When you have completed a task, present the result again. And this is often right: the management still sees a need for change, which you then implement.

Some say the GF would pseudo-involve the team.
