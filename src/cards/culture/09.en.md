**Only the management really counts!**

Your business is complex. There is a lot to consider. Your management knows the business well.
The management delegates many tasks to the team. You are excited, how much you are allowed to do yourself. Upon completion of a task, you present the result. And oftentimes, this seems to be right: the management still sees a need for change, which you then implement.

Some say the GF would pseudo-involve the team.
