**Agile Heroes**

You are intimately familiar with all the fundamental agile texts and books, down to the last detail and in their original form. You constantly question whether you have the best agile method in play. If there's a snag somewhere, a small group surely comes up with a better approach. You strive to immediately establish this approach across all areas of the company. You often speak at professional conferences about your collaboration.
Some say you prefer talking over taking real action.
