Defining and Describing the Company
Reveil a Selection card and an Organization card. Now choose a matching Mission card from two Mission cards with help of the game pieces. Repeat the process when choosing the Method and Culture card. If there is a tie, the player turns over a third card and chooses again. Tell stories together about the defined company and make notes on the working paper in the middle of the table.

React to event (5X)
Draw a role and an event. Read the cards to the group. Agree on how these cards are to be interpreted for your company.
Start with the function "You are the coach of the role".
On your rating pad, write down an action or procedure with the greatest leverage for this role and event. Present these measures to each other.
Rate the measures with a rocket (for the greatest leverage) and with a fish (this measure was the most similar to what you have already experienced).
Explain your fish + rockets to each other (note the numbers you have received on your rating pad).
Agree by consensus whether you want to swap the Role card or the Event card for the next round. Now you can also change the function of the role. Reveal the corresponding side of the function card.
