Defining and Describing the Company
Reveal one Selection card and one Organization card. Now choose a suitable mission from two Mission cards with help of the game pieces. Repeat the process for selecting the Method and Culture cards. In case of a tie, turn over a third card and choose again. Together, create and tell stories about the defined company and make notes on the work paper in the center of the table.

Reacting to Events (5X)
Draw a Role and an Event. Read the cards out loud. Agree on how these cards are to be interpreted for your company.
Start with the function "You are the coach of the role".
On your game pad, write down the action or procedure with the greatest leverage for this role and event. Present these measures to each other.
Rate the measures with a rocket (for the greatest leverage) and with a fish (this measure was almost similar to what you have experienced before).
Explain your fish + rockets to each other (note the numbers you have received on your game pad).
Agree by consent whether you want to swap the Role card or the Event card for the next round. Now you can also change the function of the role. Place the Function card with the corresponding side facing upwards.

Giving Feedback
After five rounds, provide general feedback to each other.
