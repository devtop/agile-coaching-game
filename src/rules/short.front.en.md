Game Groups
Form three or four subgroups of one or two people.

Preparation
Each subgroup receives a game pad, a pen, a fish, a rocket and a quick guide. Each player receives a round game piece.
Place the large worksheet and sticky notes in the middle of the table. For the company definition, lay out decks of cards face down: Organization, Selection, Mission, Method and Culture cards. There are also face down decks of Event and Role cards. The Function card displays "You are the coach of the role".
