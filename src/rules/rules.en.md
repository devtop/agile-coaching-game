AGILE COACHING THE GAME

I.  Aim of the Game
"Agile Coaching - the Game" is fun and encourages leaders (lateral, agile, becoming agile) and agile coaches to enter into conversation. The aim is to expand your own skills in agile systems through the exchange of experience and inspiration.
On the basis of examples, the players discuss options for action in the respective system and evaluate them. The options for action should be worked out as specifically as possible.
II. Course of the Game
The game is played in five phases:
1\. Preparing the Game Table
2\. Describing the Company
3\. Selecting the Company
4\. Clarifying Function
5\. Reacting to Events
6\. Giving Feedback
II.1.  Preparing the Game Table
The game is played with a minimum of three and a maximum of eight participants.
If more than four people are playing, some of them are playing in pairs, so that a total of four parties are playing. Single players and pairs are now referred to as subgroups.
Each subgroup receives the following materials:
\- 1 game pad
\- 1 pen
\- Game pieces of one color:
◦ 1 rocket
◦ 1 fish
◦ 1 game piece (round) for each player
In the middle of the table, lay out all the cards as a face-down deck. This is also where you put the PostIt block.
III. Selecting the Company
III.1.  Defining the Company
Reveal a Selection card and an Organization card. Read these out loud. The task is now to construct a company that is as coherent as possible and fits well with the transition task described by the Selection card.
Next, reveal two Mission cards. Read these cards aloud as well. Now use your round game piece to select the mission that best matches the Organization and Selection card. If there is a tie, turn over another Mission card, read it out and choose between the three cards. The card with the most votes will lead to the description of your company.
Repeat the voting process with two Method cards. Choose the Method card that best matches the set of Organization, Selection and Mission cards.
Finish your company selection with a choice between two Culture cards. The voting rules according to the Mission cards apply. Choose the card that matches the Organization, Selection, Mission and Method cards.
III.2.  Describing the Company
You have now put together a company. Tell each other exactly what it's like in this company.1) What are typical sayings?1) What are typical sayings?1) What are typical sayings?\
You read the part out loud.1) What are typical sayings?\

You read the part out loud.1) What are typical sayings?\
   You read the part out loud. 2) How do employees often act?\
   Share these insights in the group (or thank the initiator). 3) What would be a total break with the corporate culture?
   Note your comments on the A4 sheet in the middle of the game table. This will serve as a reminder for subsequent events.

IV.  Reacting to events
You play through a total of five events in the company.
IV.1.  Select a role in the company
You draw the top card from the "Role" deck and place it next to the description cards. Your role in the company is now fixed for this round.
Place the function card next to it. This begins with the page "You coach the role".
You read the part out loud. If necessary, explain to yourself which tasks are performed by this role in the chosen company. You can make a note of this on the A4 sheet.
IV.2.  Events in the company
IV.2.1 Read out the event
You draw the top event card and read it out loud. If necessary, clarify how the event card is to be interpreted for the company found.
IV.3.  Develop options for action with the greatest leverage
You describe an option for action with the greatest leverage for you in the named function (coach or role). An action option can contain several measures. These must be formulated coherently.
You summarize this option in writing (in bullet points) on your game pad.
The longest-serving playing group (on average) is the first to present its biggest lever. Questions are allowed in order to understand the proposed measures. Then all other groups follow in descending order of seniority.

After all options for action have been presented, you evaluate them according to the following pattern:
1\. You place your rocket on the action option that you consider to have the greatest leverage in response to the event.\
2.\
2\.\
You read the part out loud.\
You read the part out loud. You place the fish on the action option that most reminds you of an action you have already experienced.
All game groups note the number of pieces they have received on their game pad.
IV.4.  Explain ratings
You explain to each other why you have made the ratings (rocket, fish).
IV.5.  Optional: Give feedback
Make a note on the game pad with a cross in the box with the tick if you have had any special insights as a result of the developed options for action or the explanations of the assessments.
Share these insights in the group (or thank the initiator).
IV.6.  Determine the next event
You decide by consensus in the group whether you want to draw a new role card or a new event card. You can also decide by consensus whether you would like to act in the role drawn or as an agile coach for the next round. Turn the function card over accordingly.
You discard the corresponding old card and draw a new one. The game begins with V.1. or V.2.
V.  Feedback
At the end of the fifth event, you can use the room to give feedback to all your fellow players - for example, feedback on the contributions and any "aha" moments you have had.
