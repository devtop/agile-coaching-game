Agile Coaching - The Game

Gaming Group
Form three or four subgroups of one or two people.

Preparation
Each subgroup receives a gaming pad, a pen, a fish, a rocket and a quick guide. Each player receives a round game piece.
Place the large worksheet and sticky notes in the middle of the table. For the company definition, lay out decks of cards face down: Organization, Selection, Mission, Methods and Culture cards. There are also face-down decks of Event and Role cards. The function card is on the "You are the coach of the role" side.

Defining and Describing the Company
Reveil one Selection card and one Organization card. Now choose a suitable Mission card from two Mission cards with help of the game pieces. Repeat the process for selecting the Method and Culture cards. In case of a tie, turn over a third card and choose again. Together, create and tell stories about the defined company and make notes on the work paper in the center of the table.

Reacting to Events (5X)
Draw a Role and an Event. Read the cards out loud. Agree on how these cards are to be interpreted for your company.
Start with the function "You are the coach of the role".
On your gaming pad, write down the action or procedure with the greatest leverage for this role and event. Present these measures to each other.
Rate the measures with a rocket (for the greatest leverage) and with a fish (this measure was almost similar to what you have experienced before).
Explain your fish + rockets to each other (note the numbers you have received on your gaming pad).
Agree by consent whether you want to swap the Role card or the Event card for the next round. Now you can also change the function of the role. Reveal the corresponding side of the function card.

Giving Feedback
After five rounds, provide general feedback to each other.
