Agile Coaching - The Game

Players
Form three or four subgroups of one or two people.

Preparation
Each game group receives a rating pad, a pen, a fish, a rocket and a quick guide. Each player receives a round game piece.
Place the large worksheet and PostIts in the middle of the table. For the company definition, you lay out stacks of cards face down: Organization, Selection, Mission, Methods and Culture cards. There are also face-down stacks of event and role cards. The function card is on the "You are the coach of the role" side.

Define and describe the company
Unveils a selection map and an organization map. Now choose a matching mission card from two mission cards with the tokens. Repeat the process when choosing the method and culture card. If there is a tie, the player turns over a third card and chooses again. Tell stories together about the defined company and make notes on the working paper in the middle of the table.

React to event (5X)
Draws a role and an event. Read the cards to yourself. Understand how these cards are to be interpreted for your company.
You start with the function "You are the coach of the role".
On your notepad, write down an action or procedure with the greatest leverage for this role and event. Think about these measures.
Rate the measures with a rocket (for the greatest leverage) and with a fish (this measure was the most similar to what you have already experienced).
Explain your fish + rockets to each other (note the numbers you have received on your writing pad).
Agree by consensus whether you want to swap the role card or the event card for the next round. Now you can also change the function of the roller. Reveals the corresponding side of the function card.

Give feedback
Give general feedback after five rounds.
